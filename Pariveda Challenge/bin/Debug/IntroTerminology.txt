Central Processeing Unit: Part of the computer that actually runs programs - most important component of a computer

Main Memory: where a computer stores a program while the program is running

Random Access Memory: Volatile, used for temporary storage, only while the program is running, when a computer is turned off the contents of RAM are erased

Read Only Memory: Nonvolatile, does not lose its contents when a computer is turned off, typically used to store programs that are important for system operations

Secondary Storage: Memory that can hold data for long periods of time, even when ther is no power -- programs typically stored in seconday memory are loaded into main memory as needed

Input Devices: Components that collects that data and sends it to the computer -- common input devices include keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, scanner, microphone

Output Devices: Format and present data that is produced for people or other devices -- common output devices include video displays, printers, disk drives, CD recorders

Fetch: Read the programming instructions from CPU, this is the first step of processing machine language instructions

Decode: Machine language instruction is a binary number that reprsents a command that tells the CPU to perform an operations -- CPU decodes instructions

Execute: Perform the operation that has been fetched and decoded

Assembler: Used to translate an assembly language program to a machine language program

Statements: Indivdual instructions that you use to write a hight level programming language

Complier: Program that translates a high level language program into a separate machine language program

Source Code: Statements programmers write in high-level languages

Syntax Error: A mistake such as a misspelled keyword, missing punctuation, or incorrect use of an operator
